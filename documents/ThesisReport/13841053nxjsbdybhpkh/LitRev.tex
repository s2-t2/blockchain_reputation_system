\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:litrev}
The earliest and most known internet reputation is assumed to be that of
eBay~\cite{resnick2002trust}~\footnote{https://www.ebay.com}. It uses a
feedback based rating system where a user can rate a transaction along with
some textual feedback. The range of values used being \{1, 0, -1\}, positive,
neutral and negative respectively. The final aggregated score is computed by
subtracting the total of positive and negative ratings. This system could be
judged as working based on the sales volume and the observation that more than
half the buyers usually engage in providing feedback~\cite{resnick2006value}. 
However, there are various issues of an online interaction system that this
method fails to address such as: \\
\textbf{Sybil Attack:} A user(buyer/seller) can create multiple accounts(sybil
identities) and give enough positive feedback to their original account to
inflate one's reputation. Similarly, they can also provide multiple negative
feedbacks to any merchant and damage their reputation.\\
\textbf{Inactive participation:}Users are more likely to provide feedback for a
satisfactory transaction and ignore a bad deal. Since the system is not
anonymous, it is possible to trace the sender of received feedback. Therefore,
users are more likely to fear retaliation from giving negative feedback.\\ 
\textbf{Whitewashing:}The overall trust score of an entity is the difference
between positive and negative ratings received in total. As such, an account
can have a significant negative value. In which case, it is more beneficial to
start afresh with a new account then to recuperate the account with poor
reputation scores.\\

Other online systems that make use of similar reputation mechanism based on
votings/ratings are StackExchange~\footnote{https://stackexchange.com/},
yelp~\footnote{https://www.yelp.com/}, Quora~\footnote{https://www.quora.com},
Reddit~\footnote{https://www.reddit.com/}. Most of the online interaction
system (e.g., e-commerce, Q\&A platform) employ a client-server architecture
which lets a central entity in control of stored data. The centralization of
data management has both pros and cons to it. While it makes the network simple
to filter out malicious content from being served, it also acts as a single
point of failure. On the other hand, distributing data from a P2P system where
any nodes on the network can serve contents solves this issue of central point
of failure. The distributed nature of a P2P system also makes it more
straightforward to distribute malicious contents over the network. The peer
requesting a file can have it served from any participating node. If the
content of this file is malicious, then it is more likely to spread faster in a
P2P network than a centralized system. Therefore, a reputation management
system that can work in a distributed and decentralized environment is
significant for P2P systems such as file-sharing, content delivery
applications, etc. for detecting the quality of file/content or the owner of
those files. In light of this, researches and proposals on decentralized
reputation methods have been performed, few of which are discussed below.\\ 

Resnick et al.~\cite{resnick2000reputation}points out that a reputation system
should be able to provide enough information to help infer the trustworthiness
of participating users, encourage a user to be trustworthy and discourage
dishonest behavior. TrustDavis~\cite{defigueiredo2005trustdavis} is a
reputation system that addresses these concerns. It introduces the role of
insurers between interacting entities such that a user can ask to be insured
for their transaction or insure someone else's transaction in exchange for a
reward. The system relies on the insurer's capability of estimating failure
probability. Schaub, Alexander, et al.~\cite{schaub2016trustless} proposes a
block-chain based reputation model that recommends the use of blind signature
to disconnect the link between customer and ratings. Doing so lets a customer
freely rate/review the transaction without fear of retaliation. It is more
customer-centric in the sense that it allows only a customer to rate the
transaction. A merchant has no say in the quality of transactions. A buyer can
use same or different identity for different transactions. The system
recommends the latter. As such, a merchant cannot trace back the identity of
the buyer from whom he might have received the negative feedback. Therefore, an
unfair rating attack is possible in this system. A buyer who intends to damage
the merchant's(service provider) reputation can do so by giving dishonest
negative feedback.

\section{Reputation Algorithms}
The most known and widely used reputation algorithm in a P2P network is
EigenTrust~\cite{kamvar2003eigentrust} which recommends a method to aggregate
local trust values of all peers. It uses the notion of transitive trust. i.e.,
if a peer \textit{'i'} trusts a peer \textit{'j'} and peer \textit{'j'} trusts
peer \textit{'k'} then \textit{'i'} would also trust \textit{'k'}. Peers can
rate another peer as either positive or negative [-1, +1]. The users can decide
if a peer can be considered trustworthy as a download source based on its total
aggregated score. EigenTrust defines five issues that any P2P reputation system
should consider. They are self-policing (i.e., enforced by peers and not some
central authority), anonymity (i.e., peer's reputation should only be linked to
an opaque identifier), no profit to newcomers, minimal overhead for
computation/storage and robust to malicious collectives of peers. A significant
disadvantage of this algorithm is that peers are more likely to center around a
static set of pre-trusted peers that joined the network and thus has limited
reliability if they leave the network.  Pre-trusted peer is a notion of trust
where few peers that join the network are assumed trustworthy by design.
Advogato's trust metric~\cite{levien2003advogato} also uses this notion.
HonestPeer~\cite{kurdi2015honestpeer} proposes to enhance EigenTrust algorithm
further by selecting reputable nodes dynamically and not just relying on
pre-trusted nodes. It claims to have a better success rate in quality file
serving and lower malicious participation compared to EigenTrust.  As mentioned
by Alkharji, Sarah, et al.~\cite{alkharji2017authenticpeer++}, a reputation
system can serve one of the following purpose, a peer-based reputation system
or file-based reputation system. The peer-based system allows peers in the
network to be rated and assigned a value. A file-based system is concerned more
with the integrity of a file that is being delivered/served on the network
regardless of who(peer) owns or serves it.
AuthenticPeer++~\cite{alkharji2017authenticpeer++} is a trust management system
for P2P networks that combines both. i.e., it shares the notion of both trusted
peers and trusted files. As such, it only allows trusted peers to rank the file
after they have downloaded it and uses a DHT-based structure to manage the
integrity of file information.  Bartercast~\cite{meulpolder2009bartercast} is a
distributed reputation mechanism designed for P2P file-sharing systems. It
creates a graph based on data transfers between peers and uses max flow
algorithm to compute the reputation values for each node.
Tribler~\footnote{https://www.tribler.org/} is a BitTorrent based torrent
client that uses Bartercast to rank its peers.
PowerTrust~\cite{zhou2007powertrust} proposes a robust and scalable reputation
system that makes use of Bayesian learning. It uses Bayesian method to generate
local trust scores and a distributed ranking mechanism to aggregate reputation
scores. 

%\subsection{Centralized}
%%probably can move this to motivation section rather than here. 
%Currently, most of the reputation models deal with users feedback after they 
%have completed a transaction in their online platform of choice. Popular auction 
%site, ebay(footnote) is widely believed to be the biggest and best known for its
%reputation model. It uses a transaction based system where users are able to leave
%feedback about the interaction they had and can leave ratings as 0(neutral),
%1(positive) or -1(negative). These values are aggregated to compute a net score of
%users trustworthiness.
%Similarly, Q\&A websites such as Quora(footnote), Stackexchange(footnote) have their own 
%proprietary reputation model to calculate the users standings in their network. 
%Almost all the methods used are explained in web of trust(cite paper) where 
%badges, karma, activity level of users are brought into play. The common issue 
%with all of them are that they are centralized system with central point of
%authority and thus lacks transparency in correctness of information displayed.
%i.e. It is hard to tell if the information displayed about a users standing is 
%really the aggregated total of received feedback from honest users or there 
%were human intervention in the process. As it is a centralized system, it is 
%certainly possible for the admin/mod to change the rating for their 
%favored user. Other possibilities include an attacker getting access to the 
%system and changing the values to match their need. 
%
%%Since,    Also, the central point of 
%%authority implies a single point of failure making them more prone to attacks. 
%

%\subsection{Decentralized}
%There have also been various studies and implementations for decentralized systems 
%such as BitTorrent, gnutella network to employ an efficient reputation system. 
%Tribler(cite) uses blockchain based solution to keep track of users activity in the 
%network. Similarly, Beaver(cite) is a decentralized anonymous marketplace where 
%reputation scores and trust values are inferred from the participating users feedback 
%but they are left completely anonymous. TrustDavis(cite) presents a solution for 
%non exploitable online reputation system by defining important characteristics of 
%honest and malicious participants and incentivizing accurate ratings provided by the 
%user and discouraging dishonest behaviour.

% %ebay, yelp, feedback system
% Most of the online systems today deploy feedback system where all registered users 
% can rate or give feedback after they have made a transaction. Depending on the 
% amount of stars and positive comment, one might be assumed to be trustworthy to 
% start a transaction with. While these regular methods do provide assurance at a 
% certain level, they are simply not enough. First, they are based on centralized trust
% model of PKI which relies on certificate authority(cite).

% EigenTrust (cite) is a reputation management algorithm for P2P system that is based on the

% trusts all other peers trusted by \textit{j}. This method lets node generate a local trust 
% value for all the nodes it has interacted with and provides a unique global trust value for 
% the node in the network. It aims to reduce number of inauthentic files upload from untrusted 
% peers. Similarly, TrustDavis(cite) presents important distinction between honest and 
% malicious nodes behaviour in the network based on which a reputation model is proposed. 
% It makes use of max-flow network to calculate the maximum value that can flow between 
% two participating nodes. Another contribution of trustdavis is it puts insurer in the 
% middle that can vaguely be seen as escrow but have different foundation.

% robust environment using bitcoin and zcash that uses zero knowledge proof. 

%\section{Problems \& Limitations}
%Existing reputation models aggregate feedbacks and evaluate actions and
%interactions of users and store them in a centralized database. i.e., A trusted
%node has the access control and rights to publish information to the network
%which implies that it could tamper with the data at will. The traditional
%client-server architecture is also susceptible to DDOS attack as the target is
%known and holds a single point of failure. Another challenge that is not
%limited to the centralized system is Sybil attack. In any digital platform that
%doesn't require one to reveal personally identifiable information, creating
%multiple pseudonymous identities to exploit the system is usually cheaper with
%nothing to lose. Sybil attack is one of the most significant challenges in a
%distributed computing environment. It is usually challenging to detect and has
%been mathematically proven to be impossible to prevent in a distributed environment.

%\subsection{Sybil Attack}
%Sybil attack is a widely used attack model in the peer-to-peer 
%reputation system. Peers in the network create multiple 
%pseudonymous identities with a purpose of inflating their 
%reputation or damaging some other peers reputation. If a peer gets
%a bad reputation in the system for its activity or other reputation
%models defined parameters, then usually it is both cheaper and  
%faster to create a new identity and start afresh then to try and 
%recuperate the damaged reputation. As the network makes it so easy
%to create identities with nothing at stake, participants opt for it 
%and exploit this feature to perform Sybil attack.
