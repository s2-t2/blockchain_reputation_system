\chapter{Literature Review} \label{ch:litrev}
The earliest and most known internet reputation is that of
eBay\footnote{https://www.ebay.com/}.  It uses a feedback based rating system
where a user can rate a transaction along with some textual feedback. The range
of values used being [1, 0, -1], positive, neutral and negative respectively.
The final aggregated score is computed by subtracting the total of positive and
negative ratings. This system \cite{resnick2002trust} \cite{resnick2006value}
could be judged as working based on the sales volume and the observation that
more than half the buyers usually engage in providing feedback). However, this
method fails to address issues such as Sybil attack, inactive
participation(e.g., users fear retaliation from giving negative feedback).
There are many none E-commerce online systems such as StackExchange
\footnote{https://stackexchange.com/}, Yelp \footnote{https://www.yelp.com/},
Quora\footnote{https://www.quora.com/}, Reddit
\footnote{https://www.reddit.com/} e.t.c, that make use of similar reputation
mechanism to filter the participating users and avoid serving malicious
participation. Most of the E-commerce systems employ a client-server
architecture which lets a central entity in control of stored data. However,
Peer-to-Peer(P2P) systems(cite) for applications such as file sharing, content
delivery e.t.c. have studied and implemented reputation systems as well for
detecting the quality of file/content as well the peers that upload them.
\cite{resnick2000reputation}points out that a reputation system should be able
to provide enough information to help infer the trustworthiness of
participating users, encourage a user to be trustworthy and discourages the
dishonest behavior.\cite{defigueiredo2005trustdavis} is a reputation system
that addresses these concerns. It introduces the role of insurers between
interacting entities such that a user can ask to be insured for their
transaction or insure someone else's transaction in exchange for a reward. The
system relies on the insurer's capability of estimating failure probability. 

\cite{schaub2016trustless} proposes a block-chain based reputation model that
uses a blind signature(cited) to disconnect the link between customer and
ratings. Doing so lets a customer freely rate/review the transaction without
fear of retaliation. It is more customer-centric in the sense that it allows
only a customer to rate the transaction. Thus, Sybil identities is not a
concern here as a customer is allowed to make multiple identities and in fact,
a unique identifier is recommended for a unique transaction. The obvious
problem here is the unfair rating attack. A buyer can transact with a service
provider provide negative feedback with an intention to damage the service
provider's reputation despite their honest behavior in the network. 


%To name a few of them, Sovrin(cite) is a blockchain based solution for self sovereign
%identity and decentralized trust. Wepower(cite) is another innovative use case that
%aims to tokenize the renewable energy. Cardano is a blockchain platform
%that uses a ouroboros, proof-of-stake consensus algorithm (cite). Similarly,
%policypal(cite), uport(cite) are other blockchain based application focused on
%diverse use cases.
%Leveraging blockchain technology to implement reputation system could be an ideal
%solution for measuring trustworthiness and attempt to increase accuracy of trust.

% notion of transitive trust. i.e. If a peer i trusts a peer j, then it implies that

\section{Reputation Algorithms}



%\subsection{Centralized}
%%probably can move this to motivation section rather than here. 
%Currently, most of the reputation models deal with users feedback after they 
%have completed a transaction in their online platform of choice. Popular auction 
%site, ebay(footnote) is widely believed to be the biggest and best known for its
%reputation model. It uses a transaction based system where users are able to leave
%feedback about the interaction they had and can leave ratings as 0(neutral),
%1(positive) or -1(negative). These values are aggregated to compute a net score of
%users trustworthiness.
%Similarly, Q\&A websites such as Quora(footnote), Stackexchange(footnote) have their own 
%proprietary reputation model to calculate the users standings in their network. 
%Almost all the methods used are explained in web of trust(cite paper) where 
%badges, karma, activity level of users are brought into play. The common issue 
%with all of them are that they are centralized system with central point of
%authority and thus lacks transparency in correctness of information displayed.
%i.e. It is hard to tell if the information displayed about a users standing is 
%really the aggregated total of received feedback from honest users or there 
%were human intervention in the process. As it is a centralized system, it is 
%certainly possible for the admin/mod to change the rating for their 
%favored user. Other possibilities include an attacker getting access to the 
%system and changing the values to match their need. 
%
%%Since,    Also, the central point of 
%%authority implies a single point of failure making them more prone to attacks. 
%

%\subsection{Decentralized}
%There have also been various studies and implementations for decentralized systems 
%such as BitTorrent, gnutella network to employ an efficient reputation system. 
%Tribler(cite) uses blockchain based solution to keep track of users activity in the 
%network. Similarly, Beaver(cite) is a decentralized anonymous marketplace where 
%reputation scores and trust values are inferred from the participating users feedback 
%but they are left completely anonymous. TrustDavis(cite) presents a solution for 
%non exploitable online reputation system by defining important characteristics of 
%honest and malicious participants and incentivizing accurate ratings provided by the 
%user and discouraging dishonest behaviour.  
%\section{Existing reputation systems} \label{sec:sectionlabel}
% \subsection{Centralized}
% %ebay, yelp, feedback system
% Most of the online systems today deploy feedback system where all registered users 
% can rate or give feedback after they have made a transaction. Depending on the 
% amount of stars and positive comment, one might be assumed to be trustworthy to 
% start a transaction with. While these regular methods do provide assurance at a 
% certain level, they are simply not enough. First, they are based on centralized trust
% model of PKI which relies on certificate authority(cite).  
% %wot - remove untrustworthy middle man , blockchain - remove untrustwothy first person 
% % most popular reputation system in a centralized system is eBay,  

% \subsection{Decentralized}
% %P2P filesystem, Bittorrent, tribler, others
% EigenTrust (cite) is a reputation management algorithm for P2P system that is based on the 
% notion of transitive trust. i.e. If a peer \textit{i} trusts peer \textit{j} then \textit{i} 
% trusts all other peers trusted by \textit{j}. This method lets node generate a local trust 
% value for all the nodes it has interacted with and provides a unique global trust value for 
% the node in the network. It aims to reduce number of inauthentic files upload from untrusted 
% peers. Similarly, TrustDavis(cite) presents important distinction between honest and 
% malicious nodes behaviour in the network based on which a reputation model is proposed. 
% It makes use of max-flow network to calculate the maximum value that can flow between 
% two participating nodes. Another contribution of trustdavis is it puts insurer in the 
% middle that can vaguely be seen as escrow but have different foundation.
% Beaver, Decentralized Anonymous marketplace for doing transactions in a anonymous and 
% robust environment using bitcoin and zcash that uses zero knowledge proof. 

%\section{Problems \& Limitations}
%Existing reputation models aggregate feedbacks and evaluate actions and
%interactions of users and store them in a centralized database. i.e., A trusted
%node has the access control and rights to publish information to the network
%which implies that it could tamper with the data at will. The traditional
%client-server architecture is also susceptible to DDOS attack as the target is
%known and holds a single point of failure. Another challenge that is not
%limited to the centralized system is Sybil attack. In any digital platform that
%doesn't require one to reveal personally identifiable information, creating
%multiple pseudonymous identities to exploit the system is usually cheaper with
%nothing to lose. Sybil attack is one of the most significant challenges in a
%distributed computing environment. It is usually challenging to detect and has
%been mathematically proven to be impossible to prevent in a distributed environment.

%\subsection{Sybil Attack}
%Sybil attack is a widely used attack model in the peer-to-peer 
%reputation system. Peers in the network create multiple 
%pseudonymous identities with a purpose of inflating their 
%reputation or damaging some other peers reputation. If a peer gets
%a bad reputation in the system for its activity or other reputation
%models defined parameters, then usually it is both cheaper and  
%faster to create a new identity and start afresh then to try and 
%recuperate the damaged reputation. As the network makes it so easy
%to create identities with nothing at stake, participants opt for it 
%and exploit this feature to perform Sybil attack.
