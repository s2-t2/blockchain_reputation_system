The growth of online services offered possibilities to trade and interact with
anyone on a global scale freely. It also offered an accessible way for bad
actors to exploit the system. As such, trust and reputation system to detect
and limit those kinds of behavior has been a subject of interest ever since.
There is a significant amount of research literature in trust frameworks and
reputation management systems. This section aims to offer an overview of the
research literature and the implementations of trust and reputation as it
exists. 
\section{Reputation systems and algorithms}
Resnick et al.~\cite{resnick2000reputation} points out that a reputation system
should be able to provide enough information to help infer the trustworthiness
of participating users, encourage a user to be trustworthy and discourage
dishonest behavior. TrustDavis~\cite{defigueiredo2005trustdavis} is a
reputation system that addresses these concerns. It introduces the role of
insurers between interacting entities such that a user can ask to be insured
for their transaction or insure someone else's transaction in exchange for a
reward. The system relies on the insurer's capability of estimating failure
probability. Schaub, Alexander, et al.~\cite{schaub2016trustless} proposes a
block-chain based reputation model that recommends the use of blind signature
to disconnect the link between customer and ratings. Doing so lets a customer
freely rate/review the transaction without fear of retaliation. It is more
customer-centric in the sense that it allows only a customer to rate the
transaction. A merchant has no say in the quality of transactions. A buyer can
use same or different identity for different transactions. The system
recommends the latter. As such, a merchant cannot trace back the identity of
the buyer from whom he might have received the negative feedback. Therefore, an
unfair rating attack is possible in this system. A buyer who intends to damage
the merchant's (service provider) reputation can do so by giving dishonest
negative feedback. \par

The most known and widely used reputation algorithm in a P2P network is
EigenTrust~\cite{kamvar2003eigentrust} which recommends a method to aggregate
local trust values of all peers. It uses the notion of transitive trust. i.e.,
if a peer $'i'$ trusts a peer $'j'$ and peer $'j'$ trusts peer $'k'$ then $'i'$
would also trust $'k'$. Peers can rate another peer as either positive or
negative [-1, +1]. The users can decide if a peer can be considered trustworthy
as a download source based on its total aggregated score. EigenTrust defines
five issues that any P2P reputation system should consider. They are
self-policing (i.e., enforced by peers and not some central authority),
anonymity (i.e., peers' reputation should only be linked to an opaque
identifier), no profit to newcomers, minimal overhead for computation/storage
and robust to malicious collectives of peers. This master's thesis project has
followed these principles closely during the solution design of the proposed
model. A significant disadvantage of this algorithm is that peers are more
likely to center around a static set of pre-trusted peers that joined the
network and thus has limited reliability if they leave the network.
Pre-trusted peer is a notion of trust, where few peers that join the network are
assumed trustworthy by design. Advogato's trust
metric~\cite{levien2003advogato} also uses this notion.
HonestPeer~\cite{kurdi2015honestpeer} proposes to enhance EigenTrust algorithm
further by selecting reputable nodes dynamically and not just relying on
pre-trusted nodes. It claims to have a better success rate in quality file
serving and lower malicious participation compared to EigenTrust. \par
As mentioned by Alkharji, Sarah, et al.~\cite{alkharji2017authenticpeer++}, a
reputation system can serve one of the following purpose, a peer-based
reputation system or file-based reputation system. The peer-based system allows
peers in the network to be rated and assigned a value. A file-based system is
concerned more with the integrity of a file that is being delivered/served on
the network regardless of who (peer) owns or serves it.
AuthenticPeer++~\cite{alkharji2017authenticpeer++} is a trust management system
for P2P networks that combines both, i.e., it shares the notion of both trusted
peers and trusted files. As such, it only allows trusted peers to rank the file
after they have downloaded it and uses a DHT-based structure to manage the
integrity of file information. Bartercast~\cite{meulpolder2009bartercast} is a
distributed reputation mechanism designed for P2P file-sharing systems. It
creates a graph based on data transfers between peers and uses max flow
algorithm to compute the reputation values for each node.
Tribler~\footnote{https://www.tribler.org/} is a BitTorrent based torrent
client that uses Bartercast to rank its peers.
PowerTrust~\cite{zhou2007powertrust} proposes a robust and scalable reputation
system that makes use of Bayesian learning. It uses Bayesian method to generate
local trust scores and a distributed ranking mechanism to aggregate reputation
scores. 

\section{Trust Model}
Ries, S., Kangasharju, J. and Mühlhäuser, M.,
2006,~\cite{ries2006classification} have analyzed the classification criteria
of trust systems from the aspect of the domain, dimension, and semantics of
trust values. Domains of trust values can be in binary, discrete or continuous
representation. The dimension of trust values can be either one or
multi-dimensional. In a one-dimensional approach, the value represents the
degree of trust an agent assigns to another one whereas, in a
multi-dimensional, an uncertainty of trust value is also allowed. The semantics
of trust values can be in the set: rating, ranking, probability, belief, and
fuzzy value. Ratings can be specified by a range of values on a scale, such as
[1,4], where 1 can represent more trustworthy and 4 can represent less
trustworthy. Rankings are expressed in a relative way, such that a higher value
means higher trustworthiness. The probability of a trust value represents the
probability that an agent will behave as expected. Beliefs and fuzzy semantics
are based on probability theory or belief theory.  Abdul-Rahman, Alfarez, and
Stephen Hailes~\cite{abdul2000supporting} mentions in their research that trust
is dynamic and non-monotonic, i.e., additional evidence or experience with an
entity can either increase or decrease the degree of trust in another agent.
They propose a distributed trust model~\cite{abdul1998distributed} that
addresses direct trust and recommender trust. Direct trust refers to an agent's
belief in another agent's trustworthiness whereas recommender trust refers to
an agent's belief in another agent's ability of recommendations. It uses
discrete labeled trust values as $\{vt, t, u, vu\}$ for direct trust where
$vt,t,u,vu$ represents very trustworthy, trustworthy, untrustworthy, and very
untrustworthy respectively. Similarly, it uses $\{vg, g, b, vb\}$ for
recommender trust where $vg, g, b, vb$ represents very good, good, bad and
very bad respectively. An agent in this model maintains two separate sets for
direct trust experience and recommender trust experience. PGP trust
model~\cite{abdul1997pgp} employs a web of trust approach instead of a
centralized trusted authority for deriving certainty of the owner of a public
key. Users sign each other's key that they know is authentic and this process
helps to build a web of trust in and across communities. The two areas where
trust is explicit in PGP are trustworthiness of public-key certificate and
trustworthiness of introducer. Trustworthiness of introducer refers to the
ability to trust the public key in being the signer of another public key. The
degree of confidence in the trustworthiness of public-key uses a discrete
labeled value as \{undefined, marginal, complete\}. Undefined refers to
uncertainty, marginal refers to maybe the key is valid whereas complete refers
to full confidence in that the key is valid. Similarly, the trustworthiness of
the introducer is given by \{full, marginal, untrustworthy\}. In this case, full
refers to the user's full confidence in the key being able to introduce another
public key, marginal refers to uncertainty if the public key is fully
competent, and untrustworthy represents that the key cannot be trusted to
introduce another public key.  Jøsang, Audun~\cite{josang1999algebra}, proposes
the trust model that uses subjective logic to bind keys and their owners in
public key infrastructure.

%\section{Reputation Algorithms}

%\subsection{Centralized}
%%probably can move this to motivation section rather than here. 
%Currently, most of the reputation models deal with users feedback after they 
%have completed a transaction in their online platform of choice. Popular auction 
%site, ebay(footnote) is widely believed to be the biggest and best known for its
%reputation model. It uses a transaction based system where users are able to leave
%feedback about the interaction they had and can leave ratings as 0(neutral),
%1(positive) or -1(negative). These values are aggregated to compute a net score of
%users trustworthiness.
%Similarly, Q\&A websites such as Quora(footnote), Stackexchange(footnote) have their own 
%proprietary reputation model to calculate the users standings in their network. 
%Almost all the methods used are explained in web of trust(cite paper) where 
%badges, karma, activity level of users are brought into play. The common issue 
%with all of them are that they are centralized system with central point of
%authority and thus lacks transparency in correctness of information displayed.
%i.e. It is hard to tell if the information displayed about a users standing is 
%really the aggregated total of received feedback from honest users or there 
%were human intervention in the process. As it is a centralized system, it is 
%certainly possible for the admin/mod to change the rating for their 
%favored user. Other possibilities include an attacker getting access to the 
%system and changing the values to match their need. 
%
%%Since,    Also, the central point of 
%%authority implies a single point of failure making them more prone to attacks. 
%

%\subsection{Decentralized}
%There have also been various studies and implementations for decentralized systems 
%such as BitTorrent, gnutella network to employ an efficient reputation system. 
%Tribler(cite) uses blockchain based solution to keep track of users activity in the 
%network. Similarly, Beaver(cite) is a decentralized anonymous marketplace where 
%reputation scores and trust values are inferred from the participating users feedback 
%but they are left completely anonymous. TrustDavis(cite) presents a solution for 
%non exploitable online reputation system by defining important characteristics of 
%honest and malicious participants and incentivizing accurate ratings provided by the 
%user and discouraging dishonest behaviour.

% %ebay, yelp, feedback system
% Most of the online systems today deploy feedback system where all registered users 
% can rate or give feedback after they have made a transaction. Depending on the 
% amount of stars and positive comment, one might be assumed to be trustworthy to 
% start a transaction with. While these regular methods do provide assurance at a 
% certain level, they are simply not enough. First, they are based on centralized trust
% model of PKI which relies on certificate authority(cite).

% EigenTrust (cite) is a reputation management algorithm for P2P system that is based on the 
% notion of transitive trust. i.e. If a peer \textit{i} trusts peer \textit{j} then \textit{i} 
% trusts all other peers trusted by \textit{j}. This method lets node generate a local trust 
% value for all the nodes it has interacted with and provides a unique global trust value for 
% the node in the network. It aims to reduce number of inauthentic files upload from untrusted 
% peers. Similarly, TrustDavis(cite) presents important distinction between honest and 
% malicious nodes behaviour in the network based on which a reputation model is proposed. 
% It makes use of max-flow network to calculate the maximum value that can flow between 
% two participating nodes. Another contribution of trustdavis is it puts insurer in the 
% middle that can vaguely be seen as escrow but have different foundation.

%\section{Problems \& Limitations}
%Existing reputation models aggregate feedbacks and evaluate actions and
%interactions of users and store them in a centralized database. i.e., A trusted
%node has the access control and rights to publish information to the network
%which implies that it could tamper with the data at will. The traditional
%client-server architecture is also susceptible to DDOS attack as the target is
%known and holds a single point of failure. Another challenge that is not
%limited to the centralized system is Sybil attack. In any digital platform that
%doesn't require one to reveal personally identifiable information, creating
%multiple pseudonymous identities to exploit the system is usually cheaper with
%nothing to lose. Sybil attack is one of the most significant challenges in a
%distributed computing environment. It is usually challenging to detect and has
%been mathematically proven to be impossible to prevent in a distributed environment.

%\subsection{Sybil Attack}
%Sybil attack is a widely used attack model in the peer-to-peer 
%reputation system. Peers in the network create multiple 
%pseudonymous identities with a purpose of inflating their 
%reputation or damaging some other peers reputation. If a peer gets
%a bad reputation in the system for its activity or other reputation
%models defined parameters, then usually it is both cheaper and  
%faster to create a new identity and start afresh then to try and 
%recuperate the damaged reputation. As the network makes it so easy
%to create identities with nothing at stake, participants opt for it 
%and exploit this feature to perform Sybil attack.
