\chapter{Methodology and Implementation} \label{ch:method}
The problem of measuring the trustworthiness of communicating entities is an
essential aspect of any online system. This chapter follows on a discussion of
a proposed endorsement system where physically or digitally acquainted entities
can endorse each other or their presented information. The user types and their
roles in the endorsement system along with the design considerations are
discussed. A system of smart contracts is set up to specify the rules of
interaction and method to aggregate and compute the final global score for
individual entities. Deployment of the contract to the blockchain network and
analysis of data storage both on and off-chain is discussed. 

\section{Problem Statement}
To be able to rely on the trustworthiness of an entity as presented by any
online systems, the underlying reputation system needs to be robust and as
transparent as possible. The assurance that available information has not been
tampered with and correctness of claimed identity should be provided to sustain
minimal risk of fraud. The centralized nature of current online systems leaves
the propagation of reputation information vulnerable to external attacks as
well as internal modifications. As such, it fails to provide the guarantee of
reliable and immutable data. Additionally, the reputation systems do not take
into account the anonymity of participants, which is an essential attribute for
avoiding retaliation from providing honest negative feedback. This master's
thesis project proposes the use of blockchain technology for storage and
governance of reputation data to ensure reliable and publicly verifiable
information. By modeling trust among entities in a pseudonymous manner, the
proposed system also considers the users' anonymity requirements.

\section{User stories \& System Requirements} \label{ch:UserStories}
This master's thesis project proposes a decentralized endorsement system to
model trust among participating entities. As the name suggests, the proposed
system allows participants to endorse each other to reflect their subjective
opinion about other participants. Thus, the two distinct roles of users in this
system are endorser (who sends endorsement) and endorsee (who receives
endorsement). The relation between an endorser and an endorsee is an
endorsement relationship. One might want to establish an endorsement relation
with other entities in the network based on physical or digital acquaintance. \par
The acquaintance could be of the following form: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Alice and Bob go to the same school/workplace, have worked on
		multiple projects together and therefore are confident of each other's
		reliability.
	\item Alice has dealt many times with Bob in an online shopping platform
		and always had a successful transaction outcome with him. In this
		interaction, Alice is sure that Bob is an honest seller and Bob is
		confident that Alice is a reliable buyer.
	\item Alice follows Bob on some social media and knows that Bob's article
		is good and sees lots of pre-research in his writing and is confident
		that Bob doesn't engage in the false news. 
\end{itemize}

	\label{fig:context}
\end{figure}
Based on Alice's previous experience with Bob, she is likely to endorse Bob on
the endorsement system. Thus, the endorsement relationship aims to depict the
direct, personal/interpersonal trust between entities. The endorsement system
seeks to offer a simple computation model to aggregate the endorsement
interactions and assign a meaningful value to infer one's trustworthiness. If a
participant $'A'$ endorses a participant $'B'$, then it implies that $'A'$
trusts $'B'$. As such, the domain of trust value in this system is binary. An
entity $'A'$ is either endorsed or not endorsed by $'B'$ in the network. The
Figure~\ref{fig:context} in Section~\ref{ch:UserStories} shows the endorsement
interaction between users (endorser and endorsee) and the endorsement system.
In software development paradigm, user stories~\cite{cohn2004user} provide an
informal description of the feature that the system can have from an end users
perspective. Sketching user stories for the endorsement system can help to
define the roles and the associated specific features for a given user type.
Table~\ref{table:userstories} presents the user stories for different user
types of endorsement system and follows a role-feature-reason
template~\cite{agile1}. The traceability column is used to trace back to that
specific feature when checking the fulfillment of requirements in
Section~\ref{fulfillment} in Chapter~\ref{ch:results}.

	\caption{User Stories and Requirements}
\end{table}
\end{center}
The users should be able to interact in the system based on their roles and the
features allowed by the role. The endorsement acts like a transaction message
that originates from a user account and is destined to another user account. As
such, the originator account is an endorser and the destination account is that
of endorsee. Every user maintains two separate lists of participants that they
have interacted with. The first is the list of endorsers, that consists of the
account addresses of all the participants that have endorsed the user. The
second is the list of endorsees, that consists of the account addresses of all
the participants that have been endorsed by the user. Account address acts like
an identifier to the user. Based on this definition, we can lay out the system
requirements and the rationale for user interaction. \par
The functional requirements can be listed as: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It must be impossible to make an endorsement if the endorser and
		endorsee belong to the same account. \newline
		This requirement enforces a restriction that entities cannot endorse
		themselves.  
	\item It must be impossible to remove endorsement from a participant if the
		transaction initiator (account calling remove endorsement) is not in
		the list of endorsers for the participant.
	\item All the endorsements must be stored such that, it is possible to see: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item account address of endorser and endorsee for the given
				endorsement. 
			\item degree of incoming and outgoing connections for all endorsers
				and endorsees.
		\end{itemize}
	\item There must be a way to link the account address (which is the public
		key address of an account) to their corresponding global score (the
		final score used to infer the trustworthiness).
	\item It must be possible for a participant to edit their personal
		information such as their username. \newline
		Since the endorsement system does not rely on the real-world identity
		of the participants, they should be allowed to edit or update their
		personal information to their will. The trust score is linked to a
		unique identifier and cannot be actively updated by any participant.
		Computation of trust scores is explained by
		Section~\ref{sec:endorsementModel} which discusses the design of the
		endorsement system in detail. 
\end{enumerate}
The non-functional system requirements relate to the system's architecture and
can be listed as:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Security: Solidity has a list of known bugs~\cite{soliditySecurity}
		and recommendations on security considerations~\cite{solidityBugs} for
		writing smart contract code. The smart contract code for endorsement
		system should take into account minimal security considerations to
		avoid the relevant possible bugs. 
	\item Reliability: The data stored on the blockchain should be immutable
		and publicly verifiable.
	\item Trust metrics should correctly describe the actual trust score of the
		nodes.  \newline
		The definition of honest or malicious interaction based on the
		endorsement model should be reflected by the final score assigned to
		the participant. As such, the nodes showing honest behavior should have
		a better score than the malicious ones.   
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Model - Endorsement Network}\label{sec:endorsementModel}

%	\end{center}
%\end{figure}
Complete trust and reputation system should consist of four separate steps as
shown by Figure~\ref{fig:truststep}. Among these steps, the endorsement system
only concentrates on the first two steps, collection, and aggregation of
information. The information in the endorsement system refers to the
endorsement interactions between entities and values they represent. The last
two steps, selecting and interacting with a peer for transaction based on which
they get punished or rewarded is based on a transactional system. As
implementing the transaction based system is the not the main task of this
project, feedback based on success or failure of a transaction is based on the
assumption about a transaction network that can be used by endorsement system.
Thus, the system implementation is based on the smart contract logic for
endorsement model. Updating a value based on transactional outcome is purely
based on an assumption about the transaction network. \par

\subsection{Design of Endorsement System}
The design of the endorsement system is based on the requirements mentioned in
Section~\ref{ch:UserStories}. This section explains the design considerations
that were taken into account for the endorsement system. The Figure~\ref{} in
Section~\ref{} shows different components of the endorsement system and how the
users interact with them. The endorsement system allows participants to endorse
each other based on their trust opinion. Before discussing the endorsement
relationship, it is essential to understand the characteristics of trust that
is taken into account by the endorsement system. Abdul-Rahman A, Hailes
S.~\cite{abdul1998distributed} have discussed these properties of trust in their
study of a distributed trust model. \par
%First, let us make the following definitions that will be used later:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item A $\overset{endorses}{\implies}$ B, represents the relationship, $A$
%		endorses $B$.
%	\item A $\overset{trusts}{\implies}$ B, represents the relationship, $A$
%		trusts $B$, i.e., $A$ believes that $B$ is trustworthy.
%\end{itemize}
%The endorsement system considers the following characteristics of trust: 
%\paragraph{Trust is Dynamic:} This characteristic relates to the requirement of
%allowing a user to remove endorsement previously given.
%\begin{equation}
%	(A \overset{endorses}{\implies} B) \implies (A \overset{trusts}{\implies} B)
%\end{equation}
%endorses$(A, B)$ shows the trust relationship at a given time $'t'$. If $A$
%decides that $B$ is not trustworthy for any reason then $A$ should be allowed
%to do that. In which case, the endorsement information for both $A$ and $B$
%must be updated to reflect the current state. 
%\paragraph{Trust is asymmetric:} 
The endorsement system considers the following characteristics of trust:
\paragraph{Trust is Dynamic:}The trust between two individuals can change over
time. Thus, if an entity $A$ endorsed $B$ at a time $t_{1}$, then $A$ can take
back that endorsement from $B$  at any time $t_{2}$ such that $t_{2} > t_{1}$.
The endorsement system then updates this information for both $A$ and $B$ to
reflect the current state.  
\paragraph{Trust is asymmetric:}Trust relationship does not necessarily have
to be bi-directional, i.e., $A$ trusts $B$ does not always imply that $B$
trusts $A$ too. Therefore, the endorsement system does not enforce any
restriction on the endorsement relation between two entities to be asymmetric.
This attribute is demonstrated in the endorsement system by not requiring a
participant to endorse back the endorser, i.e., If $A$ is endorsed by $B$, then
it is entirely up to $B$ to either endorse back $A$ or not.
\paragraph{Trust is not transitive:}The endorsement system does not consider
the transitive trust path that can exist between endorser and endorsee. The
only way an endorsement relation can be made between two entities is via direct
endorsement. There exists trust metrics that are modeled based on the
transitive nature of trust. Depending on the context where the trust metrics is
applied, this attribute can be meaningful, e.g., in
eigentrust~\cite{kamvar2003eigentrust}, a peer $i$ is assumed to have a higher
belief in the opinion of a peer from whom he/she has received authentic
(non-malicious) files. Depending on the behavior of participants in the
network, the transitive trust can have a positive or negative outcome. If the
majority of participating nodes happen to be malicious actors (or collection of
nodes that believes in false information) then the trust transitivity could
result in the spread of incorrect information faster.  Thus, to avoid the risk
of spreading false beliefs, the endorsement system does not consider the
transitive trust for the computation of a trust score.  Christianson B,
Harbison WS~\cite{christianson1996isn} have studied the non-transitive nature
of trust in their study. 
%Thus, most of the sections is based on the smart contract logic for the
%endorsement model and discussion on the possibility to be used by other
%transactional systems.  
%
%The initial assumption on endorsement system is that all nodes are honest and
%as such receive equal points that they can spend at will, once registered on
%the network. These received points are the consumable power that keeps
%depleting with every endorsement connections made along the way. As can be seen
%in figure~\ref{consumablePoint}, these points follow a convergent sequence that
%converges to the limit zero as the number of connection `n' increases. As such,
%increasing the number of connections alone will not be enough to achieve a
%higher impact on the network.
\subsection{Computation of Total Endorsement Impact (TEI)} 
The endorsement system records all the endorsement interactions between
endorsers and endorsees. This information is aggregated for individual entities
in the system to assign a global trust score. We call this score a total
endorsement impact as it is supposed to represent the total impact a node has
made on the endorsement network. First, we define the terminologies related to
the endorsement system and present the method to compute the value for total
endorsement impact.\newline 
\textbf{{\acrshort{nEG$_A$:}}} \ac{nEG} by a participant $A$. \newline
\textbf{{\acrshort{nER$_A$:}}} \ac{nER} by a participant $A$. \newline
\textbf{ratio$_A$:} represents the ratio of \acrshort{nEG$_A$} to
\acrshort{nEG$_A$}. This value can be used to ensure that the sent and received
endorsement are not far off from each other. ratio$_{A}$ is always assumed to
be less than or equal to 1 and is given by:   
\begin{equation}
	ratio_A = \frac{min(nEG_A, nER_A)}{max(nEG_A, nER_A)}
\end{equation}
\textbf{\acrshort{CP}$_A$:} represents the \ac{CP} of a participant $A$. Every
node that joins the network receives an equal amount of consumable point from
the endorsement network. This value keeps depleting with each outgoing
endorsement connection. 1 being the initial consumable points received by
participant $A$, $CP_{A}$ is given by $\frac{1}{nEG_A}$.\newline
\textbf{\acrshort{TRP$_A$}:} This corresponds to \ac{TRP}, which is the
accumulated sum of consumable points received by $A$ from his/her endorsers.
\newline
If $E = \{e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, ......., e_{n}\}$ is a set of endorsers for a
peer $A$ and the size of $E$ is $n$, then the $TRP_{A}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
	TRP_A = \sum_{i=1}^{n}CP_{e_{i}}
\end{equation}
Finally, the \ac{TEI} made by $A$ is given by: 
\begin{equation}
	TEI_A = ratio_A \times TRP_A
\end{equation}
\subsection{Design Considerations}
The design of the endorsement system considers several possible behaviors that
can result from the interaction between nodes, both honest and malicious. Any
node that tries to manipulate (to inflate or damage the reputation) the trust
score assigned by the endorsement system is a malicious node. For instance, a
node can create multiple accounts to send multiple endorsements to a specific
account. To limit dishonest behaviors while encouraging honest interactions,
some assumptions and definitions were made from a game-theoretic perspective of
a behavioral outcome. Game theory~\cite{myerson2013game} is a study of
mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational
decision-makers. The game refers to any social situation that involves two or
more individuals, and players refer to the individuals involved in the game.
Game theory makes assumptions that each player's objective is to maximize the
expected value of his payoff, which is measured in some utility scale.
Transferring this notion to the endorsement system, the players being the
participants of the endorsement network. The assumption is made that the
objective of each participant is to maximize the trust score in the endorsement
system. Based on this assumption, some definitions were made to derive the
network influencing factors. As such, these factors can encourage honest
behavior while limiting malicious interactions in the endorsement system. 
The network influencing factors based on these assumptions are:
\paragraph{False endorsement with pseudonymous identities:} Availability and
public verifiability of reputation information is one of the primary concern of
endorsement system. As such, the system needs a public permissionless
blockchain network which allows anyone to join the network and start sending
endorsements immediately to whoever they wish to. This creates the possibility
for an entity to create multiple pseudonymous identities with an aim to inflate
their impact on the network by increasing the number of endorsements (given or
received). There is no straightforward way to detect and stop such behavior.
However, if doing so does not provide any significant advantage, then the
assumption is that a rational decision would be not to do it. The endorsement
network allocates an equal amount of consumable point each user that joins the
endorsement network. This value keeps depleting with each outgoing endorsement
connection made along the way. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{consumablePoint},
the consumable points follow a convergent sequence that converges to the limit
0 as the number of connection '$n$' increases. While there is no limit to the
number of endorsements, a participant can give, as this number increases, the
value of consumable point decreases. This value accumulatively results to the
total received points for the respective endorsee. Consider a scenario where a
participant $A$ receives endorsements from 3 endorsers, each having 2 outgoing
connections. In this case, the value of $TRP_{A}$ is 1.5. If the endorsers of
$A$ instead had 5 outgoing connections each, then the $TRP_{A}$ would be only
0.6. \ac{TRP} is one among other factors that contribute to making a better
impact score on the endorsement network. As a rational endorser, one would be
willing to make fewer meaningful endorsement connections that can contribute a
larger value than to make many connections with minimal value. As such, the
convergent behavior of consumable points is assumed to stop a participant from
making too many endorsements. 
\begin{figure}
	%\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{Images/ConsumablePoints.eps}
	\caption{Convergent behaviour of consumable points as '$n$' increases.}
	\label{consumablePoint}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Transaction Cost:}Endorsement system makes use of ethereum as a
blockchain infrastructure. As mentioned earlier, every operation executed on
ethereum consumes a certain amount of gas, which is a scarce resource. The user
account that makes a call to endorse function is responsible for paying all the
required gas costs. The endorse transaction if executed successfully updates
the state variables \ac{nEG} and \ac{nER} for the source and destination
account addresses. While the gas cost may not seem too high for making one
transaction, a malicious node with multiple pseudonymous accounts needs to pay
the gas cost of all transactions initiated from all the pseudonymous accounts.
For instance, given the interaction graph in Figure~\ref{fig:subgraphexample}, if
Alice is an honest node, then she only needs to pay for the operation of one
transaction. On the other hand, if both Bob and Charlie are the pseudonymous
identities of Alice, she needs to pay for six transactions. As the number of
pseudonymous accounts increases, the cost for maintaining the trust score on
each (or one target account) account also increases. Therefore, it is possible
that the pseudonymous accounts exchange ether with each other for having the
balance required to pay the transactions cost. This information can be publicly
verified by anyone on the blockchain network to view the chain of ownership. If
some interactions in the endorsement network look unusual (e.g., if an account
has received too many calls for removing endorsement), then one could look up
details as such. This kind of information acts as an additional factor that
might be useful to look up before making a transaction decision. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth ]{Images/subgraphexample.eps}
	\caption{Interaction between participants}
	\label{fig:subgraphexample}
\end{figure}
A successfully executed endorsement transaction modifies the \ac{nEG} and
\ac{CP} for the source account and \ac{nER} for destination account. Besides
the source and destination account, the state of \ac{TRP} for all past
endorsers of source account also needs to be modified. Therefore, a node needs
to keep track of all its neighboring (endorsers) nodes as well for correctly
computing the \ac{TEI} value. To get the total sum of \ac{CP}, it requires
iterating through the list of endorsers account. The larger the size of this
list, larger would be the cost of the computation. While it is possible to
iterate through the list of items in an array, Solidity does not generally
recommend doing so. The reason being that an unbounded loop can grow too large
and exceed the block gas limit, thereby causing the contract to be stalled.
Regardless of the amount of gas spent, the function call will not succeed. We
could assume that the list may not grow too big because a rational agent would
try to limit their endorsement connection for contributing a larger value to
other nodes in the network. Another reason we can assume so is that there is a
limit to the number of entities that one can make trust decisions about.
Dunbar's number~\cite{hill2003social}~\footnote{Dunbar's number is a suggested
cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable
social relationships—relationships in which an individual knows who each person
is and how each person relates to every other person.} says that there is a
limit of 150-200 stable social relationships that humans can maintain. A study
by Dunbar, R. I. (2016)~\cite{dunbar2016online} suggests that the growth of
online media and interactions still do not overcome those limitations. \par 
If we want to avoid relying on assumptions and expect the list to grow larger,
there are a few ways to approach this issue. One way to address this is by
setting an upper bound to the number of connections that a node can have.
Another way to approach this problem without setting a threshold value is to
move the computation to a non-blockchain platform. All the variables necessary
to compute the \ac{TRP} and \ac{TEI} can be stored and updated on blockchain as
a publicly verifiable information. The computation can be done on the
client-side using language such as javascript. The final score can be computed
by the client.  
\paragraph{Free riders problem:} The endorsement system is supposed to be a
voluntary contribution network where entities can endorse each other.
Therefore, the goal is to maintain a balanced ratio of incoming and outgoing
endorsement connections. This is enforced in a way that if a node does not
maintain the ratio then the \ac{TEI} does not increase to make a significant
impact on the network. This factor also discourages Sybil nodes because each
identity needs to have an almost equal bi-directional connection. If one is
only receiving from their pseudo identity that does not have too many
connections, then the impact is ignorant and thus not worth the effort.

\section{Implementation}
There are several components that make up the endorsement system. The process
of sending the endorsement transaction from the client's browser to executing
the contract code that can change the blockchain state is discussed in this
section. It concludes with the discussion on storage of data and variables,
blockchain network and consensus mechanism.

\subsection{Smart contracts} \label{subsec:smartcontracts}
The process of starting up the node and deploying the contract to the
blockchain network is given by Figure~\ref{fig:startup}. To compile the
solidity code, solc~\cite{} compiler can be used. A successful compilation will
give a binary representation of compiled EVM bytecodes and an ABI (Application
Binary Interface). The binary output can be deployed to the blockchain network,
after which the contract will get an address and the bytecode is stored on
ethereum. ABI is a .json file that acts as a layer of translation for
interacting with the deployed smart contracts and calling the functions. We can
then start invoking contract's code using web3 API. For the compilation script
and list of smart contracts, the reader is directed to
Appendix~\ref{smartcontracts} and~\ref{ethapplication}. A single contract that
includes all the functionalities of the endorsement system is written as an
endorsement contract. Other contracts to set the owner of the contract and
allow the possibility to kill it is based on recommendations from
zeppelin-solidity~\cite{zeppelin-solidity} and its reusable code. \par
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Images/DeployContract.eps}
	\caption{Deploy solidity contract on the blockchain network}
	\label{fig:startup}
\end{figure}
The list of contracts written for the endorsement system and its
functionalities are: 
\paragraph{Ownable:} tracks the owner of the contract by setting the address of
owner.
address.
\paragraph{Killable:}inherits from Ownable and allows the owner of the contract
to destroy the contract.
\paragraph{Endorsement:}inherits from Ownable and killable. It specifies the
core logic of the endorsement system. The method to join endorsement network,
make endorsement interactions and request trust score of an entity are separate
functionalities of this contract. Each of these methods is discussed below. 
\paragraph{New participants:}sets participant and stores their information.
It maintains the records of all the participants and an index to access/query
their information. When a user invokes the code to join the endorsement
network, it stores the address of the user account that initiated the call and
sets it as the participant. An index to access each participant is maintained
that can be used to query the state. 
\paragraph{Endorsement:}allows participants to send endorsement transaction to
the network. When the endorsed method is invoked by a user account, the state
variables ~\ac{nEG} on the account that initiated the transaction gets
incremented. Similarly, the ~\ac{nER} for the account specified by the
transaction data. The list of endorsers and endorsees is updated for both the
accounts. 
\paragraph{ComputeImpact:} allows anyone to compute the total endorsement
impact given the address of a participant. When this method is invoked, the
\ac{TRP} for the given participant is calculated by accumulatively summing the
\ac{CP} of the list of endorsers.  
\subsection{Client Application} \label{clientapp}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Images/ClientApplication.eps}
	\caption{Client Application}
	\label{fig:ClientApp}
\end{figure}
The interaction between the client application and ethereum nodes is given by
Figure~\ref{fig:ClientApp} in Section~\ref{clientapp}.
Reactjs~\footnote{https://reactjs.org/} was used for front-end development of
endorsement application. The endorsement contract that performs the endorsement
logic was deployed to Ethereum test network,
Rinkeby~\footnote{https://www.rinkeby.io/#explorer} which can be accessed
publicly and the deployment steps can be seen in Appendix~\ref{ethapplication}.
The client application makes use of web3~\cite{web3}, which is a javascript API
that allows clients to interact with a local or remote ethereum node. A user
willing to interact with the endorsement system can submit the transaction via
a client application. The client application retrieves the required detail of
the user from the key store, and signs the message with users private key and
submit the transactions over to the client node. The client node executes the
contract code that corresponds with the transaction message. A successful
execution of the contract method would change the relevant states. One of the
miner nodes would pick this transaction, broadcast it over to the blockchain
network, and the transaction thus stays as an immutable and publicly verifiable
information in the blockchain.

%	\item{P: set of participants $\{p_1,p_2,.. ..,p_j\}$ where 'j' is the total
%		number of participants.} 
%	\item{endorse(x,y): x has sent endorsement to y where $x,y \in P$}
%	\item{receive(y,x): y has received endorsement where $x,y \in P$ }

%'Marketplace' contract was written to test the endorsement network on a
%transactional network. However, when deploying endorsement system in the real
%world, other transactional network/online systems are assumed to have their
%reputation platform. The reputation platform should have assigned a score to
%the corresponding users based on the behavior on that network. The endorsement
%system can act as additional conformity for deciding on a transaction. Say,
%Alice is registered on Endorsement network and has made a decent score. If she
%wants to sell a product on Marketplace(or any other transactional network), she
%can claim about her score and anyone who wants to buy from Alice can verify the
%claim by checking the score that corresponds to her public address. If both
%Alice and buyer are registered on the endorsement network on the blockchain,
%they can send a pre-transaction message to each other to verify that Alice is
%who she claims to be and vice-versa. In case the buyer is not registered on the
%endorsement network then Alice can prove the claim by signing a cryptographic
%challenge with her private key.

\subsection{Data and variables on and off blockchain}
For this PoC, the data required to identify the users are stored on the
blockchain. But, it does preserve the anonymity requirement mentioned in
section ~\ref{ch:UserStories}, as the only public information is the link
between the public key hash and individual trust score. Even though the users
are required to register with a pseudonym, it is not needed that the aliases be
linked to real-world identity. A user might like to share more
information (other online account ids, address, etc.). As mentioned earlier in
the gas consumption section, every non-zero byte data or code of a transaction
costs a certain amount of gas \cite{buterin2013ethereum}. Storing this data can
become an expensive operation for real-world usage. The right approach can be
to use an off-blockchain storage solution such as IPFS, swarm
\cite{benet2014ipfs}. The hash that points to the file in IPFS can then be
stored on the blockchain.  Generally, client-side assets (HTML, js) are stored
on these distributed off-chain file system that can communicate to the
contracts registered on blockchain network. 

\subsection{Blockchain and Consensus algorithms}\label{subsec:bcConsensus}
The proposed platform for this PoC is Ethereum, continually developing open
source blockchain ecosystem. The process of starting up the nodes and deploying
the contract on the network is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:startup}. 
As a permissionless system, it allows any nodes to collect transactions and act
as a writer. Consensus mechanism that is generally used in a permissionless
setting is Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake. As mentioned earlier, PoW is
computationally expensive and wasteful. Using other consensus mechanisms such
as delegated proof of stake requires finding enough trustworthy validators that
can act as a leader or a master node which can be given authority to vote on
behalf of the community. In the endorsement network, an honest endorsement is
supposed to be between known entities. However, all participating entities do
not know each other, and no one node can be trusted to collect everyone's
transaction and make a final commit. Gochain~\footnote{https://gochain.io/} has
mentioned the use of PoR(Proof-of-reputation) as a consensus mechanism in its
ethereum based blockchain platform. The basic idea here is to allow
participants on the network that have a high reputation to sign the block. It
builds on the theory that it is not worthwhile for a reputed node to tarnish
the current reputation that took some time and effort to create. The
endorsement system is designed to assign a global reputation score to each
entity and could use PoR. Since reputation scores are significant to maintain,
the nodes that have an impact score within some given range can be trusted to
validate and sign the blocks of transactions. PoR on endorsement system can
only be used if the endorsement that results in an impact value becomes a
valuable asset over time through extensive use. It is not recommended to start
with it. However, PoR can be used along with PoW from the beginning. As such,
the recommended consensus mechanism for the current design is PoW despite its
limitations. Various alternatives to PoW and consensus algorithms related
research that can solve specific problems(e.g., transaction speed, transaction
size, size of nodes, etc.) are under development.

Hashgraph \cite{baird2016hashgraph}  proposes the recent advancement in
consensus engine that claims to be fair, fast and Byzantine fault tolerant. It
is based on gossip protocol(nodes gossip about transactions and gossip) and
offers mathematical proof on the total order of transactions with less
communication overhead. However, the hashgraph conundrum is that their software
is patented unlike other developments in the similar space. A developer must
pay for making an API call using micropayment of the platform.  Endorsement
system can also be used on a permissioned setting, much like sovrin
\cite{tobin2016inevitable} does.  Sovrin introduces a steward node who is
trusted based on a signed agreement with sovrin
\footnote{https://sovrin.org/library/steward-agreement/} and has received
approval as trusted institutions. The concept of steward nodes might be
questionable regarding full decentralization, but there are cases when this
level of decentralization is enough for the security of an application.   For
instance, there can be a consortium of e-commerce organizations that could
agree on a specific set of protocols. Validation of transactions can be based
on a voting mechanism that requires the consent of 2/3 of the trusted members.
Doing so can increase the transaction validation time compared to PoW.
