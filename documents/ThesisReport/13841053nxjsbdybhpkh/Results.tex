\chapter{Results} \label{ch:results}
This chapter evaluates the result of endorsement model as presented in section
~\ref{ch:method} by using interaction graph on existing dataset. Results will
be presented along with the discussion of measurement metrics and analyzed to
see if the requirements mentioned in section ~\ref{ch:UserStories} are met.

\section{Interaction graph}
In order to simulate the interaction graph, existing dataset from SNAP
\cite{snapnets} was used. The dataset was extracted from Bitcoin Alpha trust
\footnote{https://alphabtc.com/blockchain/}
weighted signed network which was essentially a who-trusts-whom network of
people that trade on Bitcoin Alpha platform. Participants on this network rated
each other on a scale of -10 to +10 where negative value represented total
distrust whereas positive value represented total trust. It consists of 3,783
nodes that made 24,186 edges out of which 93\% of the edges were marked as
positive edges\cite{kumar2016edge}.

The available information in the dataset for all the nodes was source, target,
rating, and timestamp. All of which is essential information for endorsement
network. The direction of endorsement is based on the source and target
information. The timestamp is also essential information if using a network
anomaly detection algorithm such as net flow rate convergence(cite). The
distribution of incoming and outgoing connections of each node can be seen in
figure ~\ref{inOut}.
