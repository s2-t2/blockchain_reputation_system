\chapter{Results} \label{ch:results}
This chapter evaluates the result of endorsement model as presented in section
~\ref{ch:method} by using interaction graph on existing dataset. Results will
be presented along with the discussion of measurement metrics and analyzed to
see if the requirements mentioned in section ~\ref{ch:UserStories} are met.

\section{Interaction graph}
In order to simulate the interaction graph, existing dataset from SNAP
\cite{snapnets} was used. The dataset was extracted from Bitcoin Alpha trust
\footnote{https://alphabtc.com/blockchain/} weighted signed network which was
essentially a who-trusts-whom network of people that trade on Bitcoin Alpha
platform. Participants on this network rated each other on a scale of -10 to
+10 where negative value represented total distrust whereas positive value
represented total trust. It consists of 3,783 nodes that made 24,186 edges out
of which 93\% of the edges were marked as positive edges\cite{kumar2016edge}.\\

	\label{inOut}
\end{figure}
The available information in the dataset for all the nodes was source, target,
rating, and timestamp. All of which is essential information for endorsement
network. The direction of endorsement is based on the source and target
information. The timestamp is also essential information if using a network
anomaly detection algorithm such as net flow rate convergence(cite). The rating
shows the strength or weakness of the relation. For the endorsement relation,
only the edges with a rating above two are considered. Thus, the total number
of nodes considered for endorsement interaction was 1677.\\ 
\textbf{nEG and nER:} nEG and nER is outdegree and indegree information
respectively.  The distribution of which can be seen in figure ~\ref{inOut}.
As mentioned in the requirement(req.no), each node needs to have at least 2 or
more connections to be considered for impact computation. Failing to do so
would result in an impact value equivalent to zero. Of the 1677 nodes in the
network, there were 1175 nodes(70\%) that had only one incoming or outgoing
connection. As a result, only 502 nodes(30\%) can have an impact above zero.\\

   \textbf{Node Label} & \textbf{nEG} & \textbf{nER} & \textbf{ratio} & \textbf{ReceivedPoints} & \textbf{Impact} \\

\end{tabularx}

\textbf{Received Points:} The total received point plays an equally significant
role in strengthening or weakening the total endorsement impact of a node. This
factor relies on the significance of node from whom one receives the
endorsement. Table ~\ref{table:receivedpoints} shows the nodes that have a
maintained ratio of connections but still have zero impact on the network
because of the total received points. As can be seen in figure
~\ref{fig:zeroimpact}, the endorser of nodes 430, 761, 448, 676 and 936 has no
other connection in the network. Therefore, these nodes have an impact of zero
just like their endorsers.
