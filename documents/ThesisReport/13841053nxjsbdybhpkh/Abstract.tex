\chapter*{Abstract}
The purpose of this thesis is to study blockchain technology and smart
contracts and demonstrate its use for modeling a general trust framework and
an online reputation system. The problems of existing online reputation systems
and motivation behind using a blockchain based approach are discussed. Methods
of graph properties, network flow, and graph-based algorithms are studied and
analyzed to motivate a solution. The result is a PoC design for an Endorsement
network where entities can endorse each other. The endorsement model aggregates
the interaction and via the use of simple computation steps, can assign a
global trust score to entities. This model is applied to an existing real
dataset to demonstrate the functionality, correctness, and usability. Various
threat models on a P2P network are analyzed, and an interaction graph is
simulated to show how the endorsement model handles them. It concludes with a
discussion on generalization and further improvements as future works.
