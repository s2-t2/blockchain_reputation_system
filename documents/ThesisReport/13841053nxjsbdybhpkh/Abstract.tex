\chapter*{Abstract}
Blockchain technology is being researched in diverse domains for its ability to
provide distributed, decentralized and time-stamped transactions and store them
in a cryptographically secure method. The blockchain network is attributed to
by its fault-tolerant and zero-downtime characteristics with methods to ensure
records of immutable data such that its modification is computationally
infeasible. Several use cases require the attributes mentioned above for a
secure system. Trust frameworks and reputation models of an online interaction
system are responsible for providing enough information (e.g., in the form of
trust score) to infer the trustworthiness of interacting entities. The risk of
failure or probability of success when interacting with an entity relies on the
information provided by the underlying reputation system. Thus, it is crucial
to have an accurate and reliable trust score assigned by the reputation system
and ensure that its integrity is preserved. The centralized nature of current
trust systems, however, leaves the valuable information as such prone to both
external and internal attacks. This master's thesis project, therefore, studies
the use of blockchain technology as a decentralized and distributed
infrastructure for an online interaction system that can guarantee a reliable
and immutable trust score. It proposes a system of smart contracts that specify
the logic for interactions and models trust among pseudonymous identities of
the system. The contract is deployed on a blockchain network where the trust
score of entities are computed, stored and updated in an immutable manner
without any central entity. The proposed method and the trust metrics used is
evaluated by simulating an interaction graph using an existing dataset to
demonstrate the functionality, correctness, and usability. The obtained results
then illustrate that the proposed method of trust score formulation is
resilient against several threat models of current reputation systems and the
distribution of trust scores among nodes give a clear distinction on honest or
malicious participation on the network.

%current reputation systems, design a method to model trust among pseudonymous
%entities, collect and aggregate interaction information and assign trust score
%to individual entities. The proposed method is applied to an existing dataset,
%and an interaction graph is simulated to demonstrate the functionality,
%correctness, and usability. This project presents relevant threat models that
%exist in the current reputation system and discussion on how the proposed model
%addresses them. 


%Trust frameworks and reputation systems are essential aspects of any online
%interaction system. It helps users to evaluate the trustworthiness of
%participating entities before engaging in a transaction. Therefore, the
%information available about an online identity via a reputation system needs to
%be correct, reliable and attack resistant. Most of the online transaction
%systems have a client-server architecture with centralized data point and
%governance. Thus, the data available to them are prone to both external attack
%and internal modification. Therefore, this master's thesis intends to study the
%use of Blockchain technology as a distributed and decentralized infrastructure
%that can guarantee storage of reliable and immutable trust scores. Method of
%graph properties, network flow, and graph-based algorithms are studied and
%analyzed to motivate a solution. Use of smart contracts to define the
%interaction between network participants and their collection and aggregation
%via simple computation steps is proposed. The proposed model is applied to an
%existing real dataset to demonstrate the functionality, correctness, and
%usability. An interaction graph is presented to demonstrate the different
%behavior of users in the network. The evaluation of the interaction graph shows
%that the trust metrics are representative of user behavior in a way to be
%relevant to the definition of honest and malicious interactions. Relevant
%threat models that exist in current reputation systems and how the proposed
%model can address them is discussed. It concludes with a discussion on
%generalization and further improvements as future works.
